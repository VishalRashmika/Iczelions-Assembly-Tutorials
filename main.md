The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka sits on an island covering approximately 65,630 kilometres in the Indian Ocean. It is home to 21 million people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds.The majority of the population is Buddhist, but with significant minority populations of Hindus, Christians, and Muslims. The island had been ruled by seven native kingdoms in succession. Unlike the other kingdoms like Portuguese and Dutch, the British were eventually able to occupy the entirety of the island as a Crown colony, creating British Ceylon in 1815.

Sri Lanka’s political system has been shaped by its history as a British colonial possession, dating from 1801. The British attempted to develop a representative government on the island through many constitutions like 1883, 1910, 1920, 1924, but these constitutions did not provide for local governance by the native population. The 1931 Constitution finally gave more authority to the native elected representatives over internal activities. The Dominion of Ceylon gained independence on 4 February 1948, retaining the British Crown as the Head of State and adopting the Soulbury Constitution as its constitution. Several perceived weaknesses of the 1947 Soulbury Constitution, however, eventually led to calls for a replacement, particularly from nationalists, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party's Colvin R. de Silva being a central figure in the movement.

“We seek your mandate to permit the members of Parliament you elect to function simultaneously as a Constituent Assembly to draft, adopt and operate a new Constitution. This Constitution will declare Ceylon to be a free, sovereign and independent Republic pledged to realise the objectives of a socialist democracy; and it will also secure fundamental rights and freedoms to all citizens.”
— Manifesto of the United Front, 1970,

The United Front, led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, won the 1970 general election with a two-thirds majority. As Prime Minister, Bandaranaike convened a number of committees to draft a new constitution, including a drafting committee chaired by the Minister for Constitutional Affairs, Colvin R. de Silva. This new constitution was tabled in parliament, voted on and adopted on 22 May 1972 by a vote of 119 to 16 against. This is the story of the formation of the 1972 constitution. The first constitution originated by the Sri Lanka was the constitution of 1972. It also referred to as first republican constitution. This constitution paved the way for Sri Lanka to become a republic, cutting the final ties with its colonial past and British influence. The main features of the 1972 constitution are: i) The President. The president was the head of the state, Head of the Executive and Commander in Chief of the armed forces. The President was nominated by the Prime Minister and required to act on the Prime Minister’s advice. President was only a nominal executive and had immunity from civil and criminal proceedings for the period of appointment. ii) The Prime Minister. He is effective Head of the State. He advised the President to declare a state of emergency and invoke the Public Security Ordinance. By this constitution public service had been reorganized and the public security became a major factor.

Aside from the other issues, an extremely controversial aspect of the 1972 constitution was the designation of Sinhala as the sole national language. Although the constitution did not make Sri Lanka a Buddhist state, it declared that "the Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the state to protect and foster Buddhism while assuring to all religions the rights secured by Section 18 (i)(d) [religious freedom]." Tamils, a predominately Hindu minority, resented the special status given to Buddhism and the nonrecognition of a role for their language in national life.









# Drafts
- bg of 1978 const
Before the 1977 general election the UNP had sought a mandate from the people to adopt a new constitution. Accordingly, a select committee was appointed to consider the revision of the existing Constitution.

The new Constitution, promulgated on 7 September 1978, provided for a unicameral parliament and an Executive President. The term of office of the president and the duration of parliament were both set at six years. The new Constitution also introduced a form of multi-member proportional representation for elections to parliament, which was to consist of 196 members (subsequently increased to 225 by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution).

The Constitution provided for an independent judiciary and guaranteed fundamental rights, providing for any aggrieved person to invoke the Supreme Court for any violation of their fundamental rights. The Constitution also provided for a Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) who could investigate public grievances against government institutions and state officers and give redress. It also introduced anti-defection laws, and referendums on certain bills and on issues of national importance. 


- 1978
In the July 1977 general election, the UNP was swept into power. The new ruling party, led by Jayewardene, won 140 out of 168 seats in the assembly and thus was in a position to initiate substantial revisions of the 1972 constitution. This process it proceeded to undertake by passing the Second Amendment, which established the office of executive president in October 1977. Jayewardene assumed the presidency on February 4, 1978. In November 1977, the UNP and the major opposition parties, with the conspicuous absence of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), convened a select committee to draft further revisions. After conducting a survey on the opinions of various Sri Lankan citizens, it concluded that changes embodied in the Second Amendment were not sufficient to promote substantial reform and recommended that a new constitution be drafted. The new document was adopted by the National State Assembly in mid-August 1978, and went into effect on September 7, 1978. Under its provisions, the legislature chosen in the July 1977 general election was designated the country's new Parliament.
